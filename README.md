# Alis Uniforms App

This app was created as a tool to help with the co-creative design process of of making the new (at that point in time) Thomas Tallis uniforms.

The project was initialised by the [Thomas Tallis school](http://www.thomastallis.co.uk). The workshops and the uniforms were designed by [CutX1](http://www.cutx1.com).

This App and its code was made by [Peter Koraca](http://www.peterkoraca.com) (ages ago, so don't you dare think my Java is still that bad!).

(â€¢


You can find the fully built app (sohuld work on Mac OS-X version 10.4 and higher) compressed [here](https://github.com/pkorac/AlisWardrobe/blob/master/V2_Complete.zip).

If you find the app or the code remotely useful please give me a shout.


Have fun,
Peter
