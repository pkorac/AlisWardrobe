# Alis Uniforms App

This app was created as a tool to help with the co-creative design process of of making the new (at that point in time) Thomas Tallis uniforms.

The project was initialised by the Thomas Tallis school. The workshops and the uniforms were designed by CutX1.

This App and its code was made by Peter Koraca (ages ago, so don't you dare think my Java is still that bad!).

If you find the app or the code remotely useful please give me a shout.


Have fun,
Peter
